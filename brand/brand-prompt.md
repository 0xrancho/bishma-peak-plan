As your embedded strategy partner, here's my architectural recommendation:

## Don't One-Shot It

**Split the concerns:**
1. **Loveable**: Pure UI/UX shell with mock data
2. **Claude/Cursor**: Real functionality layer

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Loveable (UI Shell Only)
Give Loveable JUST the brand guide + this simplified functional spec:

```markdown
Build a terminal-style chat interface where:
- User types messages to "Bishma" (their priority guide)
- Bishma responds with typed messages
- Tasks appear as ASCII-styled cards when mentioned
- Include these screens:
  1. Main chat view
  2. Daily briefing (terminal diagnostic style)
  3. Task list (formatted like system processes)
- Use mock data for all interactions
- Include basic navigation between screens
- Add terminal-style animations and effects
```

### Phase 2: Export & Wire Up
1. Export from Loveable once the vibe is perfect
2. Strip out their mock logic/handlers
3. Add your real implementation layer:
   - OpenAI conversation manager
   - RICE state machine
   - Airtable sync
   - Calendar integration

## Why This Split Works Better

**Loveable's Strengths:**
- Rapid UI iteration
- Visual polish
- Animation/micro-interactions
- Component library generation

**Loveable's Weaknesses:**
- Complex state management
- External API orchestration
- Business logic implementation
- Async conversation handling

Your PRD has sophisticated requirements (partial state tracking, async interviews, calendar conflict resolution) that Loveable will either:
- Oversimplify into broken implementations
- Overcomplicate their generated code
- Miss entirely while focusing on UI

## Specific Risk: The Conversational State Machine

Your most complex feature is the RICE parameter extraction with partial state management. This needs:
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Redis/memory state persistence
- Complex OpenAI prompt engineering
- Careful async handling

Loveable will likely botch this or create a naive implementation you'll have to completely rewrite.

## My Recommendation

1. **Today**: Send Loveable ONLY the brand guide + basic screen requirements
2. **Get**: Beautiful terminal UI with perfect vibes
3. **Export**: Clean component library
4. **Then**: Use Claude/Cursor to implement the real brain:
   ```typescript
   // Your implementation replacing Loveable's mock
   const handleUserMessage = async (message: string) => {
     // Your sophisticated state manager
     const state = await TaskStateManager.processMessage(message);
     // Your OpenAI orchestration
     const response = await BishmaAgent.generateResponse(state);
     // Your Airtable sync logic
     if (state.isComplete) await AirtableSync.persist(state);
     // etc.
   }
   ```

This way you get Loveable's UI magic without their attempts at complex logic that you'll need to untangle.

**Bottom line**: Use Loveable as your world-class UI designer, not your junior full-stack dev. Let Claude be your actual technical implementation partner.

Sound right?
